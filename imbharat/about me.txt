Hello World, I m Bharat Kumar Gupta, your resident 3d modeller, graphics and web design professional. I have been undertaking small, medium and large design projects since 2008, ever since my graduation, B.FA (multimedia & design) in the year 2009.

I have served small, medium and large scale organisations via my design services. I have always been intrigued by advancements in tools and technology, therefore i am an 'early adopter' for any new technology solution.
